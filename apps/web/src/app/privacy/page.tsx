        <h2>Legal Basis for Processing</h2>

        <p>
          Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information
          described in the above sections will depend on the personal
          information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.
          However, in most cases we collect the personal information to
          facilitate the business relationships we have with our Users where we
          have consent to do so, to fulfill contractual agreements, or to pursue
          our legitimate interests where these are not overridden by the
          interests, rights, or freedoms of Users. In some cases we may be
          required legally to collect or disclose personal information; in which
          case we will make this clear. In other cases, where we rely on an
          alternative legal basis, we will do so only with the appropriate legal
          requirements in place. For any questions on our legal basis for
          processing, please contact us at support@recipeui.com
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>How long do we keep your data?</h2>
        <p>
          We only process and keep any personal information for as long as
          necessary to achieve the purpose for which the information was
          originally collected. The exact length of time we keep personal
          information depends on our processing purposes and the statutory
          retention period for that type of information. After the statutory
          period of time passes, or if storage of personal information is not
          needed, personal information is deleted or anonymized.

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>
          RecipeUI takes appropriate administrative, technical, physical, and
          organizational security measures to protect your personal information
          from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure,
          alteration, and destruction. We follow industry standards to protect
          the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and
          once it is received, taking into account the nature of such
          information and the risks involved in processing, and comply with
          applicable laws and regulations. While we have taken reasonable steps
          to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware
          that despite our best efforts, no security measures are perfect or
          impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed
          against any interception or other type of misuse. For more information
          on our practices with regards to security and confidentiality please
          visit our security page. If you have any questions about our security,
          or have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer
          secure, please contact us at support@recipeui.com.

        <h2>Policy for Children</h2>
        <p>
          We do not knowingly solicit information from or market to children
          under the age of thirteen (13). If you are under age 13, please do not
          give us any personal information. We encourage parents and legal
          guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help us
          enforce our privacy policy by instructing them to never share personal
          information through our Websites without their permission. If you
          suspect or become aware of any data we have collected from children
          under age 13, please contact us immediately by emailing

        <h2>Notice for California Residents</h2>
        <p>
          The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) is a new data privacy law
          that applies to certain businesses which collect Personal Information
          from California residents. The law went into effect on January 1,
          2020. RecipeUI now offers data protection terms pursuant to the EU
          GDPR and UK GDPR in Europe and the same terms under the CCPA. Your
          rights under the CCPA are described below. Please note that RecipeUI
          does not rent or sell any Personal Information. In addition,
          California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine The
          Light” law, permits California residents to request and obtain from
          us, once a year and free of charge, 1) information about categories of
          Personal Information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct
          marketing purposes, and 2) the names and addresses of the third
          parties with which we shared Personal Information in the preceding
          calendar year. If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California,
          and have a registered account with our Websites, you have the right to
          request removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on our
          Websites. To request removal of such data, please contact us at
          support@recipeui.com and include the email address associated with
          your account and a statement that you reside in California. We will
          make sure the data is not publicly displayed on our Websites, but
          please be aware that the data may not be completely or comprehensively
          removed from our systems due to legal and regulatory requirements.

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>
          If we make material changes to this policy, we will revise the “Last
          Updated” date at the top of this policy, and in some cases, where
          required by law, we may provide you with more prominent notice (such
          as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you an email
          notification). Any changes or modifications will be effective
          immediately upon posting of the updated privacy policy. We encourage
          you to review the policy whenever you access RecipeUI to stay informed
          about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your
          privacy.
